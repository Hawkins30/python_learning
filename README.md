🏁 MILESTONE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------

After 20 projects, this repository now contains a complete foundation in Python and applied cybersecurity principles.  
Over the course of this journey, I’ve learned:

- Python fundamentals (variables, logic, loops, functions)
- File handling, JSON storage, and user authentication
- Password hashing, salting, and encryption (SHA-256, PBKDF2, Fernet)
- Network communication (sockets, clients, servers)
- Digital signatures and message integrity
- Secure system design and user input validation
- Local encrypted data management for vaults, chat, and notes

This concludes **Phase 1: Core Security Tools in Python.**

Next up:  
**Phase 2 — Building a GUI Security Suite**  
Using **Tkinter** and **Flask**, I’ll turn these CLI tools into a full desktop and web application — combining encryption, login systems, and user interfaces into one cohesive suite.
