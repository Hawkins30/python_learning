# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress as I learn Python from the very beginning.  
I’m using this to practice core coding concepts and build small, security-related tools.

---

## 📘 1. What I’ve Learned So Far
- Setting up Python, VS Code, and WSL.
- Basic commands, running scripts, and using the terminal.
- Printing text and working with variables.
- If statements and logic flow.
- Loops (`for` and `while`).
- Functions and reusing code.

---

## 🧱 2. Projects Completed
| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Password Strength Checker** | Tests password length, numbers, and symbols. |
| **File Integrity Checker** | Compares SHA256 hashes to detect file changes. |
| **Simple Login System** | Stores usernames/passwords in a text file for login simulation. |

---

## 🚀 3. What’s Next
- Add password hashing to improve security.
- Build a password leak checker.
- Explore file handling, networking, and encryption.
